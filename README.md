### Dairly Log Processing and Python learning

1. Pandas
 * dataframe is quite useful
2. Numpy
 * not use much at this moment
3. Plotly
 * Better interactive, some limitations for free account 
4. Regular Expression
 * Should not used in performance-required program
5. Scipy
 * Install in win is a disaster. Fitting function is more powerful than Numpy

### Whith ML algorithm to choose?

* Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
* Partial Least Squares (PLS)
* Support Vector Regression (SVR)
* Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN)
* K Nearest Neighbours(kNN)
* Decision Trees (DT)
* Gradient Boosted Machine(GBM)

Use classification model for prediction, probably random forest and linear regression is a good start point. Currently not enough data
